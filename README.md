# c2ma-Setup Steps
Set up instructions for the workshop.  All that is required ahead of time is a valid email which you will use to create an IBM Cloud account.

## PAIRS API key
You should have been allocated a PAIRS API key against your own email.  If you do not have one then contact ???

Take the API key and create a file called "pairpass.txt" on your own laptop.

## Create an IBM Cloud account

Click on [https://ibm.biz/COP26-workshop-2021](https://ibm.biz/COP26-workshop-2021)

Fill in Account information, email and other information as required.  You will receive a verification code to the email you specified.  Note that this code is only valide for 30 minutes.

Enter the Verification code and then an Personal Information (like password and country). 

Read the IBMid Account Privacy information and if you agree with it, scroll down and click Proceed.

You now have an IBM Cloud account which is linked to your email.

You will see a Welcome message, if you wish to have a Tour then click "Show me" otherwise click "Maybe later".  We recommend to click "Maybe later" for now.

You are presented with the initial screen of services available for you.  Note : you have what is called a "Lite" account which means that you can have access to the Free/Lite resources of each of the Services and can investigate their functionality without charge.  

We (IBM) have provided additional IBM credit in  a particular account which gives you additional access to Services above the Lite Plan. This is described further down in this README.

Click "Create"

![login-image](./images/create-watson-studio.png)

Wait a few seconds and the Watson Studio instance will be shown.

Click "Get Started"

Enter some further information.  NOTE : you need to pick your international code froom the drop down and then enter your telephone number in the field next to the code otherwise the Continue button will not be enabled.

Click "Continue"

Watson Studio is configured.

Click "Go to IBM Watson Studio"

You will now see the main Watson Studio dashboard

![login-image](./images/main-ws-dashboard.png)

Click on "New Project"

![login-image](./images/new-project-ws.png)

TODO : need to explain how to get the pairpass.txt file into the Projects area so the Notebooks can access it. Do I do this while creating a the first Project with the very simple Notebook just to test you can connect to PAIRS ?  it depends on how Anne wishes for the teams to work (i.e. one Project, multiple people, multiple Notebooks, one pairpass.txt file that all Notebooks access, so only using one PAIRS API key of one of the people).

Click on "Create an empty project"

![login-image](./images/create-project-empty-ws.png)

Before a project can be create, it needs somewhere to be saved to.  Watson Studio using Cloud Object Storage (COS) to save it's artifacts into.

NOTE : you only need to create the COS storage once and then after that all your projects will be stored in it.

Click "Add"

NOTE : A new Tab will be opened in your browser

![](./images/create-project-empty-add-cos-ws.png)

Leave the Lite Plan as shown and click "Create"

![](./images/create-cos-ws.png)

NOTE : No prompt appears that the storage has been successfully created.  Return back to the Tab where you clicked "Add" and refresh the whole page in your browser

![login-image](./images/cos-done-ws.png)

Enter a project name "test-<add something unique>" followed by your initials or something unique and then click "Create"

Cancel any prompt on a Tour

![login-image](./images/project-test-ws.png)

You will see your project main screen

![login-image](./images/project-main-screen-ws.png)

On the main screen click "Add to project" and then click on "Data"

You would have been supplied an API key to access IBM PAIRS as outlined at the start of this README.  

Click "Browse" and navigate to the location of the pairspass.txt file

### Import sample Notebook to Watson Studio
??? Need sample in github.  
Needs to use file method of accesssing the PAIRS system via an API key

### Test the Notebook
